"""
Change point subpackage for the Be Certain engine.

This module re-exports the :class:`ChangePoint` dataclass and the
:func:`detect` function from :mod:`engine.changepoint.cusum`, giving consumers
a clean import path of ``engine.changepoint`` for change point analysis
utilities.  The implementation itself lives in ``cusum.py``.
